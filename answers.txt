1) What is the coding standard that you follow when you write code in Python ?
    I follow PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal) guidelines to write code in Python.
2)Do you understand the SOLID principles? And do you use them while you write code?
    Yes, I understand SOLID principles and I used the Single Responsibility Principle for my code.
3)What are the Design patterns that you use while writing python code?
    I use the MVT (Model View Template) pattern for writing my python code.
    The Model helps to handle the database.
    The View is used to execute the business logic and interact with a model to carry data and render a Template.

    I have a little bit of knowledge about multiprocessing. But I can't get a chance to work on it.
